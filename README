Getting to know CORBA
---------------------

build with sbt 0.11+ (no build file required, just sbt compile et voila) if you like

  - based on Java 6 CORBA API
  - generate source from IDL with `idlj -fall stock.idl` (-fall for both client and server side code)

Running the example:

  - in three separate terminals do
    1. orbdaemon
    2. xisbt console
      - :l server.scc
    3. xisbt console
      - :l client.scc
